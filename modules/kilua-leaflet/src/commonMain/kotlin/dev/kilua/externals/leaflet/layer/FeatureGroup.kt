 * Extended [LayerGroup] that makes it easier to do the same thing to all its member layers:
 *
 * * [Layer.bindPopup] binds a popup to all the layers at once (likewise with [Layer.bindTooltip])
 * * Events are propagated to the [FeatureGroup], so if the group has an event handler, it will
 *   handle events from any of the layers. This includes mouse events and custom events.
 * * Has `layeradd` and `layerremove` events
